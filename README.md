MLTester
========

Arduino-based moving light component tester. Tests entire modules (color, gobo, etc) of Martin MAC 700 fixtures, or individual motors and sensors. Currently only works for modules with microswitch-based end-of-travel sensors. Magnetic and optical sensors (for gobo wheels and pretty much everything in a VL) are currently unsupported, but should work pretty similarly.


File name is MACDuck because I think we had a foam duck head mounted on the stepper shafts to show movement?
